# PuzzleSolver
### Description
   This command line tool illustrates the five most commonly-used searching algorithms for state-space search in modern 
   artificial intelligence. Three algorithms represent uninformed search, while two represent informed searches. You can read    more about state-space search (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_search).
   
   There are also three different types of problems solved by the algorithms, as displayed here.
 

### Synopsis
  ```python puzzlesolver.py [algorithm_used] [configuration_file]```
    
  The following options for [algorithm_used] can be one of the following:
  1. bfs - Breadth-first search (
  2. ucs - Uniform-cost search
  3. iddfs - Iterative-deepening depth first search
  4. greedy - Greedy local search
  5. a* - A* search 
### Dependencies
