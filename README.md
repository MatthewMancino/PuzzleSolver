# PuzzleSolver

## Synopsis
  '''python puzzlesolver.py [algorithm_used] [configuration_file]'''

   
    
## Description
   This command line tool illustrates the five most commonly-used searching algorithms for problem-solving in modern Artificial
   Intelligence. There are also three different types of problems solved by the algorithms, as displayed here.
  The following options for [algorithm_used] can be one of the following:
  1. bfs - Breadth-first search
  2. ucs - Uniform-cost search
  3. iddfs - Iterative-deepening depth first search
  4. greedy - Greedy local search
  5. a* - A* search 
 
### Dependencies
  Python Interpreter (Used version 2.7.1)
  Configuration file (examples listed in /examples)

###Problem Types
  There are three problem types listed in the PuzzleSolver application: 
  1. Sensor-tracking optimization problem 
  2. Data-aggregation problem
  3. "Burnt" Pancake Problem
#### Sensor-tracking optimization problem
